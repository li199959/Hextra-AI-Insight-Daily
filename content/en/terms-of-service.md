# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

👋 Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (which we'll call "**the Site**" or "**we**"). Before you dive into using our services, please take a moment to really read these Terms of Service. By hitting up or using the Site, you're totally agreeing to and accepting these terms.

## 1. Quick Look: Our Services
What does **the Site** dish out? Well, we provide awesome paid subscription content and membership services! This includes cool stuff like blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and even community interactions. Keep in mind, some goodies are only for our subscribed members.

## 2. Your Account & Registration
*   To get an account, **users** need to whip up a valid email address and set a password.
*   **Users** are totally responsible for their account's security and all activities under it. Seriously, **NO** transferring or sharing your account – that's a big no-no! 🙅‍♀️
*   If **users** mess up and violate these terms, **the Site** has every right to **suspend or terminate** their account.

## 3. Paid Subscriptions: The Lowdown
*   **Subscription services** are billed either monthly or annually, and you'll see all the costs crystal clear on the checkout page.
*   **All payments** are handled via third-party platforms (like Stripe or PayPal) because, nope, **the Site** doesn't store any of your payment info. We keep it secure!
*   Heads up: **Subscriptions** will **automatically renew**, unless you cancel before your current billing cycle wraps up.
*   **Our 14-Day Refund Policy**: If you're a first-time subscriber to our services and you're not totally thrilled within 14 days of purchase, you can totally ask for a full refund. Just hit us up at the contact email provided at the end of these terms and tell us why you're bouncing. Each user gets one shot at this refund. After 14 days, or if it's not your first subscription, payments are **NON-REFUNDABLE**, unless the law absolutely says otherwise.

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
*   **All original content** is copyrighted by **the Site (hubtoday)**. Please don't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without permission!
*   **Users** only snag a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** for personal learning and reading. Keep it to yourself, fam!
*   If you're looking to use content for commercial purposes or need to quote a lot of it, just reach out to **the Site** to get proper authorization.

## 5. User Conduct: Play Nice! 😇
*   **Users are strictly forbidden** from uploading, posting, or spreading any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or violates anyone else's rights. Don't be that person!
*   It's also a **BIG NO** to mass download, crawl, or crack member content using technical wizardry. Seriously, don't even try it.
*   **The Site** has every right to yank inappropriate content and **ban any naughty users** who don't play by the rules.

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
*   **We** totally reserve the right to tweak, pause, or totally stop any part or all of our services at any time, without giving you a heads-up. Just keeping it real!
*   If content becomes temporarily unavailable due to things beyond our control like force majeure, server glitches, or third-party service interruptions, **the Site** will **NOT be held liable for any compensation**. Bummer, we know, but it happens.

## 7. Disclaimer: Just So You Know! 😉
*   **The information provided by the Site** is for reference purposes only and **DOES NOT** constitute any professional advice (like financial, legal, medical, etc.). Don't come suing us for your life decisions!
*   **The Site** will **NOT be responsible** for any direct or indirect losses users might cop from using our content or services. Just sayin'.

## 8. The Legal Stuff: Governing Law
*   **These Terms of Service** are governed by and interpreted under the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Standard legal talk!
*   **Any disputes** cropping up from or relating to these terms should first be sorted out amicably between both parties. If that doesn't work out, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California.
