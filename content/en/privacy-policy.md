# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: June 1, 2025*

---

This Privacy Policy spills the tea on how we handle your info – collecting, using, and disclosing it – when you hop on board and use our Service. It also fills you in on your privacy rights and how the law has your back.

Heads up! We use your personal data to keep our Service running smoothly and to make it even better for you. By using our Service, you're basically saying 'yep, I'm cool with you collecting and using my info as outlined in this Privacy Policy.'

## Let's Break It Down: Interpretations & Definitions

### Interpretations, You Ask?
Words capitalized? They've got meanings defined under these specific conditions. And get this: whether they show up in singular or plural form, those definitions stick!

### Definitions Galore!
For the sake of this Privacy Policy, here's what we mean when we say these things:

- **Account** means a unique account created for you to access our Service or parts of our Service. 🤘
- **Affiliate** means an entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with a party, where "control" means ownership of 50% or more of the shares, equity interest or other securities entitled to vote for election of directors or other managing authority. (Phew, that's a mouthful!) 🤓
- **Company** (referred to as either "the Company," "We," "Us," or "Our" in this Agreement) means **hubtoday**. That's us! 😉
- **Cookies** are tiny files that a website places on your computer, mobile device, or any other device. They hold details of your browsing history on that site, among other things. Nothin' too spooky, promise! 🍪
- **Country** refers to: California, United States. Golden State vibes! ☀️
- **Device** means any gadget that can access the Service, like a computer, cellphone, or a digital tablet. You know, your tech fam! 📱
- **Personal Data** is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual. Basically, stuff that's tied to *you*! ✨
- **Service** means the Website. Easy peasy! 👍
- **Service Provider** means any natural or legal person who processes data on behalf of the Company. Think of it as third-party companies or individuals hired by the Company to make the Service happen, assist with Service-related tasks, or help us analyze how the Service is being used. Our helping hands! 🙌
- **Usage Data** refers to data collected automatically, either generated by the use of the Service or from the Service infrastructure itself (for example, the duration of a page visit). It's the behind-the-scenes info! 📊
- **Website** means **hubtoday**, which you can check out at `https://ai.hubtoday.app/`. Go on, give it a visit! 🌐
- **You** means the individual accessing or using the Service, or the company, or other legal entity on behalf of which such individual is accessing or using the Service. That's *you* right there! 👉

## Gathering and Using Your Personal Data

### Types of Data We Collect

#### Personal Data (It's About You!)
When you're using our Service, we might ask you to dish out some personally identifiable information that we can use to contact or identify you. This juicy info might include, but isn't limited to:

- Email address
- Usage data

#### Usage Data (The Auto-Collected Stuff)
Usage data? Yep, that's automatically collected when you use the Service. It just happens!

This Usage data might include your device's Internet Protocol address (think of it as your IP address), browser type and version, the pages you visit on our Service, the time and date of your visit, how long you chill on those pages, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data. Pretty detailed, right?

When you're accessing the Service via your mobile device, we might automatically collect certain deets. This includes, but isn't limited to: the type of mobile device you're rockin', its unique ID, your mobile device's IP address, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile internet browser you're using, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data. We like to know what you're workin' with! 📱

And hey, when you visit our Service (or hit it up via mobile), we might also collect information that your browser sends our way. It's all part of the digital handshake! 🤝

### Tracking Technologies and Cookies (The Digital Footprints) 👣
We totally use Cookies and other similar tracking tech to keep tabs on activity on our Service and squirrel away certain info. The tracking technologies we deploy include beacons, tags, and scripts. They're all about collecting and tracking info to help us make our Service even better and understand how it's being used. Some of these technologies might be:

- **Cookies or Browser Cookies**: A Cookie is a tiny file dropped onto your Device. You can tell your browser to say 'nope' to all Cookies or give you a heads-up when one's being sent. But just a friendly warning: if you don't take Cookies, you might not be able to use certain parts of our Service. So, unless you've tweaked your browser settings to decline Cookies, our Service might just be using them! 🍪
- **Web Beacons**: Some parts of our Service and our emails might contain these little electronic files called web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs). These snazzy files let the Company, for instance, count users who've visited those pages or opened an email. They also help with other website stats, like checking how popular a certain section is and verifying system and server integrity. Sneaky, but useful! 👀

So, Cookies can be either 'Persistent' or 'Session' Cookies. When you go offline, Persistent Cookies stick around on your personal computer or mobile device. Session Cookies, though? Poof! They vanish the moment you close your web browser. Like magic! ✨

We rock both Session and Persistent Cookies for these purposes:

- **Necessary / Essential Cookies** (Can't live without 'em!)
  - **Type**: Session Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are absolutely vital to get you the services available through the Website and to let you use its cool features. They help verify users and put a stop to any dodgy use of user accounts. Without these Cookies, the services you've asked for simply can't be provided, and we only use these Cookies to hook you up with those services. No joke! 💯

- **Cookies Policy / Acceptance Cookies** (Are you in?)
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are here to figure out if users have given a thumbs-up to the use of cookies on the Website. So, did you? 👍

- **Functionality Cookies** (Making life easier!)
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are the real MVPs; they let us remember choices you make when you use the Website. Think remembering your login deets or language preferences. The whole point of these Cookies is to give you a more personal experience, so you don't have to keep punching in your preferences every single time you use the Website. How convenient is that? 😉

Wanna dive deeper into the Cookies we use and your options regarding them? Swing by our Cookies Policy or the Cookies section of our Privacy Policy. We've got all the answers! 📖

### How We Use Your Personal Data (The "Why" Behind It All!) 🤔
The Company might totally use Personal Data for these cool purposes:

- **To provide and maintain our Service**: This includes keeping an eye on how our Service is being used, making sure it's always tip-top! ✨
- **To manage Your Account**: We'll handle your registration as a user of the Service. The Personal Data you hand over gives you access to all the different functionalities available to you as a registered user. Sweet! 🔑
- **For the performance of a contract**: This means developing, complying with, and nailing the purchase contract for the products, items, or services you've bought, or any other contract with us via the Service. We stick to our agreements! 🤝
- **To contact You**: We might reach out via email, phone calls, SMS, or other equivalent electronic communication forms (like push notifications from a mobile app!). We'll keep you in the loop with updates or informative comms related to functionalities, products, or contracted services – including security updates – whenever it's necessary or makes sense. Stay connected! 📞
- **To provide You with news**: Get ready for special offers and general info about other goods, services, and events we're offering. We'll only send stuff similar to what you've already bought or inquired about, unless you've told us you're not keen on receiving such info. Your call! 📰
- **To manage Your requests**: We'll process and handle any requests you send our way. We're here to help! 💌
- **For business transfers**: We might use your info to evaluate or go through with a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or any other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets. This could be as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or a similar proceeding. In these cases, the Personal Data we hold about our Service users is one of the assets that could be transferred. Big business stuff! 💼
- **For other purposes**: Yep, we might also use your info for other cool stuff, like data analysis, spotting usage trends, figuring out how awesome our promotional campaigns are, and constantly evaluating and sprucing up our Service, products, marketing, and your overall experience. Always improving for you! 🌟

Now, we might just share your personal information in these scenarios:

- **With Service Providers**: We might share your personal info with Service Providers to monitor and analyze how our Service is being used, and to get in touch with you. They help us keep things running smoothly! 🛠️
- **For Business Transfers**: We might share or transfer your personal info during any negotiations of, or in connection with, any merger, sale of Company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company. Again, big business, but transparent! 📝
- **With Affiliates**: We might totally share your info with our Affiliates. If we do, we'll make sure those Affiliates play by the rules of this Privacy Policy. Our Affiliates include our parent company and any other subsidiaries, joint venture partners, or other companies that we control or that are under common control with us. It's a family affair! 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
- **With Business Partners**: We might team up and share your info with our business partners to hook you up with specific products, services, or awesome promotions. Win-win! 🎉
- **With other users**: When you get chatty and share personal info or interact in public areas with other users, remember that info might be seen by all users and could even be out there publicly. So, be mindful! 💬
- **With Your Consent**: If you give us the green light, we might spill your personal info for any other purpose you agree to. Your choice, always! ✅

### Keeping Your Personal Data (For How Long?) ⏰
The Company will only hang onto your Personal Data for as long as it's necessary for the purposes we've outlined in this Privacy Policy. We'll also keep and use your Personal Data to the extent needed to meet our legal obligations (like if we have to keep your data to comply with applicable laws), sort out disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies. We play by the rules! ⚖️

The Company will also keep Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Generally, Usage Data is held onto for a shorter period. The exceptions are when this data is used to boost the security or improve the functionality of our Service, or if we're legally obliged to keep this data for longer periods. It's all about safety and making things better! 🔒

### Transferring Your Personal Data (A Global Journey!) 🌍
Your information, including Personal Data, gets processed at the Company's operating offices and any other places where the parties involved in the processing are located. What does this mean? It means your info might be zipped over to, and kept on, computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction. Heads up, the data protection laws there might be a bit different from what you're used to! 🌐

By agreeing to this Privacy Policy and submitting such information, you're basically giving a nod to that transfer. Cool? Cool. ✅

The Company promises to take all reasonably necessary steps to make sure your data is treated securely and totally in line with this Privacy Policy. We won't transfer your Personal Data to any organization or country unless there are adequate controls in place, including rocking some serious security for your data and other personal information. Your data's safety is our priority! 🛡️

### Deleting Your Personal Data (Your Right to Vanish!) 👻
You've got the power! You have the right to delete or ask for our help in deleting the Personal Data we've collected about you. Poof, gone! ✨

Our Service might even let you delete certain info about yourself right from within the Service. How convenient is that?

You can totally update, modify, or delete your info anytime by logging into your account (if you have one, of course!) and hitting up the account settings section that lets you manage your personal information. Or, you can just give us a shout to request access to, correct, or delete any personal information you've given us. We're here to help you manage your digital life! 🧑‍💻

But hey, just a heads-up: we might need to hang onto certain info when we have a legal obligation or a lawful basis to do so. Rules are rules! 📜

### Spilling the Beans: Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions (Big Moves!) 💼
If the Company ever gets caught up in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data might just be transferred. But don't you worry, we'll give you a heads-up before your Personal Data is moved and becomes subject to a whole new Privacy Policy. We'll keep you informed! 📢

#### Law Enforcement (When the Law Calls) 👮
Under certain circumstances, the Company might get asked to spill your Personal Data if the law demands it or if there's a valid request from public authorities (like a court or a government agency). We gotta follow the law! 📜

#### Other Legal Requirements (Covering All Bases!)
The Company might totally disclose your Personal Data if we genuinely believe that such action is necessary to:

- Go with the flow and comply with a legal obligation
- Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
- Shield the personal safety of Service users or the public
- Guard against legal liability

### Keeping Your Personal Data Safe (We Try Our Best!) 🔒
The security of Your Personal Data is a big deal to us, no doubt! But here's the thing to remember: no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is ever 100% secure. While we totally bust our chops to use commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, we just can't guarantee its absolute security. We're doing our best, though! 💪

## Kiddo Privacy (13 and Under, Listen Up Parents!) 🧒👧
Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under the age of 13. Nope, not intentionally! We don't knowingly scoop up personally identifiable information from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you *know* your child has given us Personal Data, please get in touch with us. If we figure out we've collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verifying parental consent, we'll move fast to ditch that info from our servers. Kids' safety first! 💖

If we need to rely on consent as the legal basis for processing your info, and your country requires parental consent, we might just ask for your parent's consent before we collect and use that info. Parental approval is key! 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

## Links to Other Websites (A Digital Detour!) 🔗
Our Service might have links that lead to other websites that we don't operate. If you click on a third-party link, you'll be whisked away to that third party's site. We seriously recommend you take a peek at the Privacy Policy of every single site you visit. Stay savvy! 🤓

We have zero control over, and take no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. Just a heads-up! 🤷‍♀️

## Changes to This Privacy Policy (Heads Up for Updates!) 🔄
We might update our Privacy Policy every now and then. When we do, we'll let you know about any changes by simply posting the new Privacy Policy right here on this page. Easy peasy!

Before those changes kick in, we'll give you a heads-up via email and/or a super noticeable announcement on our Service. Oh, and we'll also tweak that 'Last updated' date at the top of this Privacy Policy. You'll always be in the know! ✍️

We totally recommend you give this Privacy Policy a regular once-over for any changes. Any tweaks to this Privacy Policy become effective the moment they're posted on this page. Stay in the loop! 🚀
